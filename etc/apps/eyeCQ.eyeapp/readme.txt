eyeCQ v.1.0 - May 7, 2006
-------------------------
Now you can chat with your ICQ buddies from within eyeOS.
Chat messages pop up in windows outside of the eyeOS window,
which allows you to continue chatting even when the eyeCQ
window is not focused in eyeOS.

eyeCQ allows you to chat with friends on both the ICQ and
AOL/AIM networks.  If you do not have an ICQ or AIM login,
please sign up for one (free) at: www.icq.com/register

eyeCQ currently uses Flash for its interface, and therefore
an installed copy of the Flash plugin is required for your
browser before eyeCQ will run.


Known Bugs:
- The first message you send (by double-clicking on a user)
  is fairly slow to pop up.  Once it's up, it runs fast and
  smooth, but that first message can take a few moments.
  
- Because eyeOS reloads applications when you change your
  focus to a different eyeApp, you will be signed-off eyeCQ
  if you change focus.  Please keep this in mind, and try
  to keep eyeCQ focused while chatting.  It's horribly
  inconvenient, and hopefully I'll find a way around this.
