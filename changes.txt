Changed htmlentites to htmlspecialchars in funcions.php -> userinput()

Corrected width and height for .icnbrossa (Trash Icon layer) in Default and 
BlueIris themes

config buttons open:

    !node || (node = document);

With fix above, eyeCalendar stopped working ! Fix :
In apps/eyeCalendar.eyeapp/calendar.js line 307 
From :
  ele = getElementsByClass (ele, 'Cal_today');

To :
  ele = getElementsByClass (cal, 'Cal_today');

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

X0.9.0-2b to X0.9.0-2e  -----> released as eyeOS 0.9.0-2
----------------------

Added new function in funcions.php: userinput(), which corrects possible issues
in user-input text in some apps.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

X0.9.0-2a to X0.9.0-2b
----------------------

system/scripts/x_eyeOSwin.js
  Changed function closeAll (used in system session close) to following :

  function closeAll () {
    sysCall ('sys', 'wclose', '*', null, null, false);
    window.location = "index.php";
  }

  This makes the syscall synchronous and we wait for the server before asking 
  for the login screen. This solves the session close not working issue


system/scripts/x_eyeOSwin.js
on eyeOS.info and eyeOSdemo [but not on my local system] running IE cannot 
  close apps or exit session ("Object error"), window move gives same error 
  (and a more useful "Cannot create moverequest" message) 

  The issue is creating the HTTPrequest object, the "object Error" is an alert 
  when an MS HTTPreq object is not created

  Rewrote the newRequest function. The new function will alert IE users to the 
  fact that their configuration does not allow HTTPrequest creation and 
  indicates how to correct that  
  
index.php
  line 244 changed heaader from
  
    header('Location: desktop.php');
 to
    header('Location: desktop.php' . (@$a ? '?a='.urlencode($a) : ''));

   This passes to desktop the apps to autorun.
 
 
eyemessages.eyeapp/applic.php
  (check) was not working
  
  line 26 changed from 
    if ($autorun = (is_file ($msrc) && (filemtime ($msrc) > $appinfo['state.lastread'])))
  to
    if ((substr($mf, 0,1) != '.') && $autorun = (is_file ("$msrc$mf") && (filemtime ("$msrc$mf") > $appinfo['state.lastread'])))

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.0-1 to X0.9.0-2a 
--------------------

apps/eyeNav.eyeapp/aplic.php: 
   SOLVED BROKEN IMAGE


apps/eyeEdit.eyeapp/aplic.php: 
   SOLVED OVERFLOW HEIGHT TOO BIG


system/funcions.php:(showAppIcon function)
   CHANGED WIDTH FOR IE TO NEW WIDTH OF ICONS


system/funcions.php:(AppIcon function):
  
   showAppIcon ($imgsrc = $appicons[(isset ($_SESSION['apps'][$app]) && !empty($appicons[1])) ?  1 : 0], $app);
 to
   showAppIcon ($imgsrc = $appicons[(isset ($_SESSION['apps'][basename($app)]) && !empty($appicons[1])) ?  1 : 0], $app);

   Reason: App was coming from $_SESSION['usrinfo']['apps'] - app list- and contained the URL to the app 
   (for example, apps/eyeEdit.eyeapp). For correctly showing the ico_b.png (with the error was showed always
   ico_c.png) we need the basename of the app (just the name of it), that is what SESSION(apps) contain.


Added BlueIris as default theme (size > 1MB... :( )
